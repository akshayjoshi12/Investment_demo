"# Investment_demo" 
Instructions for setup:
1> Check DB folder in which you will find sql file. Import that file in database first.
2> Go to application/config/database.php and change username, password, db name etc as per your database.
3> Hit url "http://localhost/investment_demo/" in any browser.
4> You can see the form with 2 fields say "Date" and "Investment Amount". I have not imported all the values for fund into database right now so you can enter date 02-Jul-2019. Enter any amount and then click on submit. A popup with calculated value on 02-Jul-2019 as well as today("12-Dec-2019") will be shown.
